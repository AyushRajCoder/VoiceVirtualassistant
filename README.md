****Meet Ayusence : Your Personal Voice Assistant — Powered by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!****

After weeks of coding and fine-tuning, I’m thrilled to introduce Ayusence, a voice-driven virtual assistant built from the ground up using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ayusence can respond to basic commands, search the google, and even provide the latest weather updates according to the place — all through voice interaction! While it’s designed as a standard desktop website, it showcases the powerful capabilities of browser-based voice recognition, creating a seamless user experience.

This project is a step towards making web interactions more intuitive and hands-free. Stay tuned for future updates as I continue to improve Ayusence features!
